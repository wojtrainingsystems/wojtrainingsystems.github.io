Here are client testimonies.


> Jake is not my first coach and I wasn’t  new to bodybuilding, But I’m brand new to this kind of coaching. 
> I’ve been able to successfully go through a leaning out and then building phase with Jake and I couldn’t be happier with the results of both! His programming is well thought out,  backed by science and also just as importantly, experience. 
> You don’t just get a coach, you get a friend, a supporter, a cheerleader who gets just as excited as I do about my achievements and progress. You get someone who is happy to tell you when he increases your carbs during a building phase and says “EAT UP!” I’ve never had a coach that enthusiastic about his clients eating food and enjoying it! 
> He encourages a healthy lifestyle that doesn’t just include what I eat and what workouts I do. He addresses day to day life and how to make better, healthier choices for myself. Even in really stressful, tough times in my personal life, having Jake to help keep me on track gave me something to work for and a sense of achievement that kept me going. 
>It’s a big decision to trust someone completely to get you to your goals. That’s how I felt. But I’m here to tell you that with Jake’s guidance I didn’t reach the goals I set for myself. I reached bigger ones.
